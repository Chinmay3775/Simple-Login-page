# Simple Login Page

This is a simple login page created with HTML and styled using Bootstrap. The login functionality is built in PHP and connects to a MySQL database to validate user credentials.

## Live Demo
The live preview of this page is available here:
[Simple Login Page Demo](https://chinmay3775.github.io/Simple-Login-page/login.html)

### Important Note
The login functionality on this page **will not work** in the live demo, as the PHP code requires a connection to a database hosted locally on the developer's laptop. For security reasons, the database is not publicly accessible.

## Features
- Simple, responsive login form design
- HTML and Bootstrap for quick styling
- Backend PHP code for authenticating users

## Files in Repository
